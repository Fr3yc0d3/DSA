### Indtroduction To Data Structure 

A data structure organizes related data on a computer so that it can be used effectively. 
 
Different types of data structures are suitable for different kinds of applications, and some of them are highly specialized for specific tasks. For example, diagrams are used to represent connections on social sites (such as Twitter, Facebook), trees are used to represent hierarchical data such as files and folders in the file system, queues can be used to create task schedulers, compiler implementations typically use hash tables for search for identifiers, binary trees are used in search algorithms, etc. 
 
Usually, choosing the right data structure is the key to designing an efficient algorithm. 
 
Some of the more common data structures are: 
- Array 
- Linked list 
- Stack, queue 
- Graph, Tree 
- Hash table
